In 1786, farmers in western Massachusetts were faced with a seemingly insurmountable challenge.  Property taxes had been raised fivefold to pay off the dept that the state incurred fighting the American war for independence.  Additionally, a poll tax had been levied on every man aged 16 years of age or older.  These taxes had to be paid in gold or silver coin.  Unfortunately, the farmers of western Massachusetts had very little need for such currency in their lives.  Instead, their economy was largely one of barter and personal notes.  When the farmers were unable to pay the taxes and threatened with the loss of their property, they armed themselves and prevented the circuit court in Northampton from seating a jury to conduct the legal proceedings for the state to seize their lands.  This worked to preserve their lands for another month until the court could re-convene.  The tactic worked so successfully, that other farmers in the region did the same thing in other places.  Eventually, these farmers, most of whom were veterans of the American Revolution, found leadership under Daniel Shays.  These men had learnt how to respond to a government that imposes unfair taxes on its people.  Eventually, these men attacked the Federal armory at Springfield, Massachusetts.  However, William Shepard had preemptively called out the militia to defend the armory.  Two cannon shots were fired over the attacking force.  When these had no effect, two more were fired into the advancing men.  This had the effect of dispersing the soldiers.  Shortly afterward, a privately-funded army arrived, under the command of Revolutionary War hero, Benjamin Lincoln, and the incident known as Shays' Rebellion ended.  The following  year, John Hancock was elected governor of Massachusetts.  He issued this proclamation offering clemency to all but a few of the participants in Shays' Rebellion.
