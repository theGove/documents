On the 22nd of November, 1765, Parliament passed the Stamp Act, which levied a tax on all printed documents and other named items in America, including: newspapers, almanacs, pamphlets, broadsides, legal documents, dice, and playing cards.



The Stamp Act marked the first time that Parliament passed a law taxing internal trade in the American colonies...and the American response was severe. Colonists responded with organized protest. Throughout the colonies, a network of secret organizations known as the Sons of Liberty was created, aimed at intimidating the stamp agents who collected Parliament's taxes. Before the Stamp Act could even take effect, all the appointed stamp agents in the colonies had resigned. 



The Massachusetts Assembly suggested a meeting of all the colonies to work for the repeal of the Stamp Act. Most colonies sent representatives and the Stamp Act Congress passed a "Declaration of Rights and Grievances," which claimed that American colonists were equal to all other British citizens, protested taxation without representation, and stated that, without colonial representation, Parliament had no right to tax the colonies.  



The declaration included 14 points, one of which asserted that restrictions imposed by the late acts of Parliament would make colonists unable to purchase manufactured goods from Great Britain. After the Stamp Act Congress met, efforts to boycott British imports intensified, putting pressure on British merchants, who pressured Parliament to repeal the act, which it did on March 18th, 1765.



Although the Stamp Act was in effect for fewer than six months, the response to it united the colonies in a way that they had never before unified. It produced the claim that "taxation without representation is tyranny" and set the colonies on the road to independence.



This document was printed to announce the "glorious news" that the Stamp Act had been repealed.
