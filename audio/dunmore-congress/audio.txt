In 1774, the colonies in America worked together for the first time since the Stamp Act crisis. They convened a Continental Congress in Philadelphia to determine what should be done to alleviate the suffering of the people of Massachusetts because of the Intolerable Acts. 



Their solution was to enter a non-importation, non-exportation agreement among all the colonies. The hope was that it would put pressure on the merchants in England to intervene on their behalf to put an end to the Intolerable Acts. 



They concluded with a resolution stating that if their concerns had not been resolved by the following year, they would convene again to consider what next steps should be taken. When Governor Dunmore learned of this, he issued this proclamation ordering no one from Virginia to represent the colony at the next Continental Congress, should there be one called. 


Fortunately, for the founding of the Nation, both George Washington and Thomas Jefferson ignored this proclamation and attended the congree in Philadelphia.
