When the Second Continental congress ordered the first printing of the Declaration of Independence from their printer, John Dunlap.  The manuscript sent to the printer was signed in a manner similar to other acts of Congress, by the president, John Hancock, and by the secretary, Charles Thompson.  So, when you view a copy of the Declaration printed in 1776, you'll see only those two names at the bottom.  In January of 1777, Congress ordered this printing of the declaration.  By this time, 55 of the 56 signers had added their names to the document.  So, this printing is the first to include the names of the signers. The final signer of the declaration, Thomas McKean, will add his signature about one week after this printing was made.  



If you look at the last line of this document, you will see that it was printed in Baltimore.  By this time, congress had fled Philadelphia because it had become clear that the continental army would not be able to stop the British from capturing the capital of the new republic.  When they reconvened in Baltimore, congress chose Mary Cathrine Goddard to be their official printer.  Many people find it odd that Congress would choose a woman to be their official printer.  However, the prejudice against women in the workplace arrives in America in the middle 18 hundreds.  In the late 17 hundreds it was perfectly normal for a woman to be the sole proprietor of a business. Congress had no hesitation in choosing Mary Cathrine to be their official printer for two reasons.  First, she was the best printer in Baltimore, and second, she was the postmaster, so not only could she print, she could deliver.
