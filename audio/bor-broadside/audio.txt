The year is 1789. The constitution, which had been written in 1787, has now been ratified and become the law of the land. Many states ratified the Constitution with the understanding that among the first tasks taken up by the new Congress would be to create a bill of rights, making several amendments to the Constitution to guarantee and protect fundamental rights to the people. Hundreds of suggested amendments were sent in and under the leadership of James Madison, the house of representatives produced a first draft of the Bill of rights, including 17 amendments. This draft was then sent to the Senate, and it whittled those amendments down to twelve. Those twelve amendments were sent to the states for ratification during the 18th century. Ten of those were ratified, and they stand today as our Bill of rights. The very first proposed amendment was never ratified, but the Second Amendment was ratified in 1995, making it the 27th amendment to the constitution. It stipulates that when Congress votes themselves a raise, they're not allowed to receive that raise until there has intervened an election in the House of Representatives. This document is one of only two known broadside printings of the Bill of Rights as it was going out for ratification.
