After the battles of Lexington and Concord, Military governor Thomas Gage, instituted Marshall Law in Boston. No one was allowed to enter or leave the city without a pass issued under his authority. This form was filled in with the authorized traveler's name and how many people were in his family. The provincial congress of Massachusetts struck a deal with General Gage to allow patriots who were in the city to leave and to allow loyalists outside the city to enter.
