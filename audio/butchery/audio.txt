After the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the friends and families of those who gave their lives in the conflict produced a broadside memorial. This document lists the dead and wounded from each community and includes an elegy poem, honoring the fallen. It also reprints newspaper articles describing the events of April 19, 1775. Those who produced it express their hopes that, quote, every Householder in America, who are sincere Well-wishers to the American Colonies, may be possessed of a copy.  Either to frame and glass, or otherwise to preserve in their Houses, not only as a Token of Gratitude to the Memory of the Deceased Forty Persons, but as a perpetual Memorial of that important Event, on which perhaps may depend the future FREEDOM and GREATNESS of the COMMON-WEALTH of AMERICA.
