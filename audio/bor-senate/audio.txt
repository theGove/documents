Among the very first work undertaken by the first Congress of the United States of America under the Constitution, was to create a bill of rights. The House of Representatives made a first draft of that bill, including 17 articles. The Senate then undertook to produce a version of the Bill of Rights, beginning with the work that the House had produced. Through editing and combining, they produced a document with twelve articles that went to the states for ratification.  This document is a working draft of the bill of Rights for discussion in the senate.  It contains twelve articles, but if you study them closely, you will notice that the wording is different from those that were sent out for ratification in many significant places. This document was printed by John Greenleaf, the official printer for Congress in New York.
