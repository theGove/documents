In March of 1776, the Second Continental Congress was moving toward declaring independence from Great Britain but several delegates still held out hope for reconciliation. However, by this time, the colonies had been at war with the mother country for eleven months, having already had the battles of Lexington, Concord, and Bunker Hill.  The congress had authorized private volunteers, or privateers, to attack British shipping on the high seas, both commercial and military.  By this time, the privateers had captured many vessels as prizes of war.  It seems that the one thing that the Congress can agree upon is that if America is to overcome its problems with Great Britain, it will take the help of almighty God.  



To that end, this proclamation calls for all people in the American Colonies to join together in a day of  "humiliation, fasting, and prayer" to seek the blessings of God on behalf of the colonists.  On one hand, it seeks to disentangle the conflict with Great Britain and restore the former felicity between Mother England and the Colonies, but if that is not to be, it seeks to strengthen the army of the United Colonies in the day of conflict.



This proclamation was issued less than four months before the Declaration of Independence.
