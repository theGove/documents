This broadside lays out the rules that Congress requires to be followed by all privateers who set out to capture prizes of war in the name of the United Colonies of America. It specifies that at least one-third of each vessel's crew must be landsmen.  It also prevents the ransoming of prisoners taken on the high seas.  Failure to conform to these rules could result in a vessel that was formerly acting in the name of the United Colonies being classified as a pirate ship, thus invalidating the letters of marque and reprisals carried therein.
