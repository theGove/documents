On July 2, 1776, the Second Continental Congress voted to declare independence from Great Britain.  They then spent a couple of days adjusting the draft written by Thomas Jefferson and on July fourth, they voted to approve the wording and have the document printed.  



Late in the night of July fourth and early in the morning of July fifth, the first printed copies of the Declaration of Independence were pulled from the press of John Dunlap, the official printer for Congress.  Congress had ordered John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin to be sure that the Declaration was printed correctly in every detail.  



Several times through the night, they will call out, "stop the press" to make corrections.  Although they will not change any words, several times they will make corrections in punctuation.  Because of this process, we know something about the printing order of the twenty-six copies known to exist today.



With this document, Congress is declaring independence on behalf of more than three million people, yet they printed only 200 copies.  They sent one to George Washington, he had it read to the troops.  They sent two to King George.  Apparently, they wanted to be doubly sure that HE got the message.



However, most of them were sent to the printers of newspapers so the declaration could be disseminated more broadly.
