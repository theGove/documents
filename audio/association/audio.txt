For most of their existence, the British colonies in North America did not cooperate. Instead, they saw themselves as competitors for royal favor. Although nine colonies worked together to seek a resolution to the Stamp Act Crisis in 1766, once the act was repealed, they returned to their competitive ways. 



After Massachusetts colonists destroyed the 92 tons of tea in the Boston Tea Party in 1773, Parliament punished Massachusetts with a set of new laws referred to as the Coercive Acts. These punitive acts severely curtailed the livelihoods of many Massachusetts colonists and made life miserable for almost all of them.



These acts, later called the Intolerable Acts, were so extreme that the colonists in eleven other colonies decided to join Massachusetts in a continental congress to make a united plan to work for the repeal of the Coercive Acts and to ease the suffering of their brothers and sisters in Boston and throughout Massachusetts. 



In October of 1774, the Continental Congress forged a lasting continental association among 12 colonies comprising fourteen resolutions to pressure Parliament and to reduce the colonies’ dependence on the mother country. Central to the plan was a non-importation and non-exportation agreement, but the resolutions also provided for increasing the manufacture of woolen goods and for living more frugally. Additionally, the resolutions banned the international slave trade and pledged to cut off all commerce with those engaged in it, making the Continental Congress the first elected, representative body to take such an action against slavery. The ban was honored by the colonies for a decade.
