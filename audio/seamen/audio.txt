In March of 1777, John Paul Jones had this advertisement printed to recruit both seamen and landsmen to join him as privateers.  He calls for, "All GENTLEMEN SEAMEN and able-bodied LANDSMEN who have a Mind to distinguish themselves in the GLORIOUS CAUSE of their Country, and make their Fortunes" to join him in fighting the British on the high seas.  He offers to reimburse reasonable travel expenses and to pay a bounty of forty dollars to each able seaman and a bounty of twenty dollars for ordinary seamen and landsmen who will enlist.  Such bounties would be deducted from any prize money the new privateers might win at sea.
