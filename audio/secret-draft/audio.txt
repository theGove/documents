When the delegates to the 1787 Federal Convention met in Philadelphia, among the first decisions they made was that their deliberations would be held in secret.  The delegates felt that this way, they would be talking to each other rather than to their constituencies back home.  The convention got off to a hopeful start when Edmund Randolph presented the Virginia Plan.  The general feeling among the delegates was that, while there was some work to do, the Virginia plan was a grand start and their work might be concluded in a few weeks' time.  Then William Patterson, from New Jersey, presented a plan that was acceptable more to the smaller states.  Alexander Hamilton presented his own plan, which mirrored the government of Great Britain.  Now, delegates began to wonder if they would be able to come to an agreement about a new form of government for the young republic.  



That's when the committee of detail was formed to make an initial, coherent, working draft from the ideas presented to this point.  That committee produced a proposed constitution spanning seven pages and including 23 articles.  For the first time, details about the convention's deliberations were allowed to leave Independence Hall.  The secret draft was taken to the printing house of John Dunlap and this document was printed.  Because it was to be a working draft, it was printed with wide margins so the delegates could write in changes as they were agreed upon.



Once the constitution was approved by the convention in September, George Washington, president of the convention, ordered that all copies of prior drafts be collected so they could be burned.  Washington felt it important that the new constitution stand on its own feet and that the details of other ideas considered not be made public.  However, a few delegates smuggled their copies out.  It's happy for us that they did or we would not know the details of this first draft.
