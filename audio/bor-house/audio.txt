James Madison fought hard to convince the states to meet for a federal convention to amend the articles of Confederation. This convention ultimately produced the United States Constitution. Again, James Madison worked for years to convince states to ratify. Many of the states ratified on the condition that the new Congress seriously undertake to create a bill of rights. And hundreds of suggested amendments to the Constitution were sent to the new Congress. It fell to James Madison again to organize these proposed amendments into a cohesive bill of rights. This document is the result of the work that James Madison did, along with his committee and the House of Representatives. You'll notice that it has 17 articles. There's still much work to be done before it's ready to be sent out for ratification, and that work will be undertaken by the Senate.
