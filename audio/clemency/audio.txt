The year 1776 and most of 1777 were dark times for the prospects of American Independence.  Many people despaired for the newly proclaimed republic and thought the safest course was to pledge allegiance to the crown.  However, after the victory at Saratoga in September of 1777, the outlook began to change.  By 1778, France had openly entered the war to support the United States.  Now that prospects for continued independence seemed bright, congress felt that many Americans who had embraced the crown were holding to that allegiance only because they feared punishment for turning their backs on their country.  To encourage those who wished to return their fealty to America, Congress resolved that each state should issue pardons to those who had waivered but who now wished to return.  Congress lacks the authority to issue such pardons itself, so this resolution is only a recommendation to the legislature or executive of each state to act accordingly.
