In July of 1776, the Second Continental Congress sent a copy of the Declaration of Independence to Isaiah Thomas, publisher of the Massachusetts Spy.  Thomas received the copy on July tenth, after the weekly printing of the Massachusetts Spy was complete. However, he did not want to wait a full week for the news to get out.



On July 14, Thomas made the first public reading of the Declaration from the steps of the Worcester courthouse.  According to his grandson and biographer, "The declaration was received with every demonstration of joy and confidence"



Because the Massachusetts Spy was the most popular newspaper in North America, more Americans first read the Declaration as printed here than in any other format.



You will notice that the full text of the Declaration does not quite fill the front page, so Thomas added an advertisement for an apothecary shop, which was the drug store of the 18th century.  Quite possibly, this advertisement represents the best money ever spent on a printed promotion as it is still being printed after more than 245 years--at no cost to messieurs Shepard and Hunt.  Sadly for them, however, they are no longer reaping the benefit of this free advertising having closed their doors more than 200 years ago.
