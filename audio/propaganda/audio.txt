After the Battle of Bunker Hill, the British soldiers occupied Bunker Hill and the Massachusetts Militia occupied Prospect Hill. This handbill, printed by Isaiah Thomas, compares the condition of the British soldiers on Bunker Hill with that of the Massachusetts militia on Prospect Hill. It was printed for distribution to the British soldiers occupying Boston. The Americans were very successful at delivering this message to those soldiers to entice them to come over to the American side.  



However, as propaganda goes, it was very ineffective. Few, if any, British soldiers defected as a result of this appeal. Although about 90 percent of the Massachusetts militia could have read this well enough to understand the message, that number was never above 15 percent in the 18th-century British army. Although they received the message, they could not understand its content.
